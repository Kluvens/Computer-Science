## Components of a Graph
Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. 
Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. 
Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.

Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. 
It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. 
Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. 
There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. 
Every edge can be labeled/unlabelled.

## Different Types of Graphs

### Complete Graph
A complete graph is a graph in which each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge.

### Directed Graph
A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u).
The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.

## Important Concepts

### Minimum Spanning Tree
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

### Shortest Path
The shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.
