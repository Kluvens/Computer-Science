## Union Find
A disjoint-set (union find) data structure is defined as a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. 

It has two main operations:
- Find: determine which subset a particular element is in.
This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
- Union: join two subsets into a single subset. Usually keep one representative and then make another as a subset.
