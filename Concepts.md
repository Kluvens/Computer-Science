## Data Integration
Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. 
It involves bringing together data that is stored in different formats, structures, and locations and transforming it into a common format that can be easily analyzed, queried, and reported on. 
Data integration is often used in business intelligence, data warehousing, and big data analytics to enable organizations to gain insights from their data and make more informed decisions. 
There are various approaches to data integration, including manual methods such as data entry and data warehousing, as well as automated methods such as extract, transform, load (ETL) and data virtualization. 
The ultimate goal of data integration is to provide a unified view of the data that is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

## API and Socket
An API is a higher-level interface that enables communication between software components, while a socket is a lower-level interface that enables communication between programs across a network. 
APIs are typically used for more abstract and structured forms of communication, while sockets are used for more low-level, real-time communication.

## Unit test and Integration test
Unit tests are focused on testing individual components, or units, of a software application in isolation.
They are typically automated tests that verify the behaviour of small, well-defined pieces of code such as functions, methods, or classes.
The purpose of unit tests is to catch defects and ensure that the units of code work as expected and meet the requirements.
Unit tests are usually written by developers, who use testing frameworks to create and run the tests.

Integration tests, on the other hand, test the interactions between different components or modules of a software application.
They are designed to detect defects in the interfaces and interactions between components and ensure that they work correctly when combined.
Integration tests can be automated or manual and may involve testing the communication between different modules, testing the data flow between them, and verifying that the integrated system meets the requirements.
Integration testing is typically performed by a separate testing team or by developers as part of a larger test plan.
