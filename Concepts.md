## Data Integration
Data integration is the process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, unified view. 
It involves bringing together data that is stored in different formats, structures, and locations and transforming it into a common format that can be easily analyzed, queried, and reported on. 
Data integration is often used in business intelligence, data warehousing, and big data analytics to enable organizations to gain insights from their data and make more informed decisions. 
There are various approaches to data integration, including manual methods such as data entry and data warehousing, as well as automated methods such as extract, transform, load (ETL) and data virtualization. 
The ultimate goal of data integration is to provide a unified view of the data that is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

## API and Socket
An API is a higher-level interface that enables communication between software components, while a socket is a lower-level interface that enables communication between programs across a network. 
APIs are typically used for more abstract and structured forms of communication, while sockets are used for more low-level, real-time communication.
