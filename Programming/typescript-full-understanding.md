## Big things to note about TypeScript
TypeScript provides:
- Type safety: using types to prevent programs from doing invalid things
  - a better way to understand this is that a number cannot multiply a list and calling a function with a list of strings when it actually needs a list of objects
  - Javascript tries to make the best of doing things and avoids exceptions whenever it can
  - Typescript can tell you when you made a mistake when actually run programs
- Typechecker: a special program that verifies that your code is typesafe
- Type system: a set of rules that a typechecker uses to assign types to your program
  - we can explicitly annotate types, or we can let Typescript infer most of them for us
  - Explicit way to signal the type is by `value: type`
  - In general, keep explicitly typed code to a minimum

## The Compiler
Things to start with:
- programs are files that contain a bunch of text written by programmers
- The text is parsed by a special program called a compiler, which transforms it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), a data structure that ignores things like whitespace, comments, and where you stand on the tabs versus spaces debate.
- The compiler then converts that AST to a lower-level representation called typecode.
- Then we feed that bytecode into anther program called a runtime to evaluate it and get a result
  - i.e. When you run a program, you are just telling the runtime to evaluate the bytecode generated by the compiler from the AST parsed from your source code.
- One thing special about Typescript is that typescript is first compiled to Javascript then run Javascript code

So the overall process of compiling Typescript is:
1. Typescript source code -> Typescript AST
2. AST is checked by typechecker
3. Typescript AST -> Javascript source code
4. Javascript source code -> Javascript AST
5. AST -> bytecode
6. Bytecode is evaluated by runtime

Steps 1-3 are done by TypeScript Compiler (TSC) and steps 4-6 are done by the Javascript runtime.
