## Spring
The Spring Framework (Spring) is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
One of the most popular Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) frameworks,
Spring helps developers create high performing applications using plain old Java objects (POJOs).

Spring is considered to be a secure, low-cost and flexible framework.
Spring improves coding efficiency and reduces overall application development time because it is lightweight.
Spring removes tedious configuration work so that developers can focus on writing business logic.

A web application commonly includes three layers:
- presentation/view layer (UI) - this is the outermost layer which handles the presentation of content and interaction with the user
- business logic layer - the central layer that deals with the logic of a program
- data access layer - the deep layer that deals with data retrieval from sources

Spring's core logic is dependency injection.
Dependency injection is a programming pattern that allows developers to build more decoupled architecture.
Dependency injection means that Spring understands the different Java annotaions that a developer puts on top of classes.
Spring also understands the dependency and makes sure that all instances created have properly populated dependencies.

Important terms:
- Bean - A Spring bean is an object that is instantiated, created, and managed by the IoC container. Beans are the backbone of an application.
- Dependency injection - A programming design pattern that makes code loosely coupled, meaning that any change in the application of one, will not affect the other.
- Inversion of control (IoC) - Taking control away from the class and giving it to the Spring Framework.
- Inversion of control container - This is the core of the Spring Framework where objects are created, wired together, configured, and managed throughout their life cycle.

## Micro Service
Micro service is an architecture that allows the developers to develop and deploy services independently.
Each service running has its own process and this achieves the lightweight model to support business applications.

## Spring Boot
Spring Boot uses Spring as its foundation layer and allows developers to build a standalone application with none or minimal configuration.
It is targeted specifically towards building web applications and microservices.

## Spring MVC
Spring MVC: Spring MVC is a Web MVC framework for developing or building web applications. It contains many configuration files for various capabilities. Spring MVC is an HTTP-oriented web application development framework.

Spring MVC is considered to be the model view controller-based web framework under the Spring framework.

## Spring Cloud
Spring Cloud provides tools for developers to quickly build some of the common patterns in distributed systems (e.g. configuration management, service discovery, circuit breakers, intelligent routing, micro-proxy, control bus, one-time tokens, global locks, leadership election, distributed sessions, cluster state).

## Mybatis
MyBatis is a Java persistence framework that couples objects with stored procedures or SQL statements using an XML descriptor or annotations.

MyBatis does not map Java objects to database tables but Java methods to SQL statements.
MyBatis lets you use all your database functionality like stored procedures, views, queries of any complexity and vendor proprietary features.
It simplifies coding compared to JDBC.
SQL statements are executed with a single line.

## Maven
Maven is an open-source software project management tool that is primarily used for Java projects.
Maven addresses the two main aspects of software development; dependency, and how software is built. In maven, An XML file describes the building process of a project, its dependencies, components, and other external modules. There are predefined targets for tasks like packaging and compiling.

Maven provides a very rigid model that makes customization tedious and sometimes impossible.

## Gradle
Gradle is a build automation tool that is an open-source and builds based on the concepts of Apache Maven and Apache Ant. It is capable of building almost any type of software.
It is designed for the multi-project build, which can be quite large.
It introduces a Java and Groovy-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) instead of XML (Extensible Markup Language) for declaring the project configuration.
Gradle provides support for the building, testing, and deploying software on different platforms.

Gradle avoids work by tracking input and output of tasks and only running what is necessary, and only processing files that changed when possible.

Reuses the build outputs of any other Gradle build with the same inputs, including between machines.

A long-lived process that keeps build information "hot" in memory.
