## Spring
The Spring Framework (Spring) is an open-source application framework that provides infrastructure support for developing Java applications.
One of the most popular Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) frameworks,
Spring helps developers create high performing applications using plain old Java objects (POJOs).

Spring is considered to be a secure, low-cost and flexible framework.
Spring improves coding efficiency and reduces overall application development time because it is lightweight.
Spring removes tedious configuration work so that developers can focus on writing business logic.

A web application commonly includes three layers:
- presentation/view layer (UI) - this is the outermost layer which handles the presentation of content and interaction with the user
- business logic layer - the central layer that deals with the logic of a program
- data access layer - the deep layer that deals with data retrieval from sources

Spring's core logic is dependency injection.
Dependency injection is a programming pattern that allows developers to build more decoupled architecture.
Dependency injection means that Spring understands the different Java annotaions that a developer puts on top of classes.
Spring also understands the dependency and makes sure that all instances created have properly populated dependencies.

Important terms:
- Bean - A Spring bean is an object that is instantiated, created, and managed by the IoC container. Beans are the backbone of an application.
- Dependency injection - A programming design pattern that makes code loosely coupled, meaning that any change in the application of one, will not affect the other.
- Inversion of control (IoC) - Taking control away from the class and giving it to the Spring Framework.
- Inversion of control container - This is the core of the Spring Framework where objects are created, wired together, configured, and managed throughout their life cycle.
